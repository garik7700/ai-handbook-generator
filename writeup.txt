# AI Handbook Generator – Write-up

## Project Summary

I built an AI-powered chat application that generates long-form
handbooks (~20,000 words) from uploaded PDF documents.

The system uses a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
PDF files are split into chunks, embedded, and retrieved using cosine
similarity. The most relevant chunks are injected into the AI prompt
to ensure grounded answers.

For handbook generation, the system first creates an outline and then
iteratively expands each section, allowing generation of very long
documents beyond single-context limits.

## AI Models Used

The application uses a local large language model (LLM) served through
Ollama. This allows the system to run fully offline without relying
on external cloud APIs.

The architecture is model-agnostic and can be adapted to use other
models such as Grok, GPT, or Claude by replacing the LLM interface.

## Challenges

The main challenges during development were:

### 1. Handling large documents  
PDF files can be very large, which leads to memory issues and long
processing times. This required implementing chunking and limiting
context size for stable performance.

### 2. Long text generation  
Generating a 20,000-word handbook exceeds the context window of most
LLMs. This was solved by generating an outline first and then expanding
each section iteratively.

### 3. Performance and memory  
Early versions consumed too much RAM due to large embedding arrays.
This was improved by processing chunks in batches and limiting
the number of retrieved contexts.

### 4. External service instability  
Cloud services and APIs were unreliable or unavailable during testing.
To avoid this, a fully local setup using Ollama was chosen.

These challenges led to a more robust and reproducible final system.

## Development Tools and AI Assistance

During development, several AI tools were used as assistants:

- Kilo Code and Antigravity were used for coding support and debugging.
- ChatGPT and Grok were used for reasoning, explanations, and design
  discussions.

These tools were used as productivity aids. All final design decisions,
integration, and testing were performed manually.

## Outcome

The final application allows users to:
- Upload PDFs
- Chat with AI about the content
- Generate and export long handbooks

The system runs fully offline using a local language model and meets
the task requirement of generating long-form AI-powered documents.
